I’m a front-end developer passionate about breaking down complex problems and turning them into intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces. I care deeply about product usability and strive to create experiences that feel smooth and natural for every user. Currently, I’m at Meituan, working on the foundational R&D platform with a focus on container and monitoring systems. Outside of work, you’ll often find me at the gym or checking out exhibitions. Recently, I’ve been exploring French and swimming, enjoying the little adventures that come with learning something new. I appreciate my solo and self-sufficient time and the freedom to follow whatever catches my curiosity.

My journey into programming kicked off during my undergrad in Digital Publishing at Wuhan University. As a freshman, I got my feet wet with the basics of computer science, databases, and Python. But what truly sparked my passion was a course on semantic publishing—there, I used HTML and CSS to create a webpage dedicated to my favorite figure skater, Yuzuru Hanyu. This experience opened my eyes to the charm of web development———literally, you can build anything you envision with code.

I sharpened my front-end development skills through internships at Internships at Wuhan University's Big Data Institute and later at NIO Inc. Working closely with developers, designers, testers, and product managers, I loved the buzz of a team pulling together to make our product better. And there’s nothing quite like the thrill of seeing my own code being used by thousands—it’s what solidified my decision to pursue a career in front-end development.

I’m now doing my Masters in Computing and IT at the University of St Andrews. I thrive on programming challenges and enjoy working with teams to solve complex problems. I specialize in technologies such as React, Next.js and Vue, and have a solid understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript and HTML/CSS.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and building interesting projects. I also run my social media accounts on platforms like Bilibili and Xiaohongshu, where I share tech tips and tricks. And when I’m not at the computer, you’ll find me cooking up a storm, catching a movie, or keeping fit with regular workouts.
